# Ethworks Task 1

## Task Description
Write a function to add two simple mathematical expressions which are of the form Ax^a + Bx^b + … (where the coefficients and exponents can be any positive or negative real
number).  
 That is, the expression is a sequence of terms, where each term is simply a constant
times a variable to an exponent. You don't have to do string parsing, so you can use whatever
data structure you'd like to hold the expressions.

### Example:
For input with two expressions:
- > 2x^2 + 3

- > 3x^3 + x^2

Provide the output:
- > 3x^3 + 2x^2 +3

## How to run my solution?
- > npm install
- > npm start

## How to use?
1. Type a polynomial, you can use x, x^2 convention
2. Remember use operator (+,-)
3. Under an input there is the draft of your polynomial
4. If everthing is okey, click "Add" - your polynomial is saved below
5. Back to 1 and add an another part :)

## Test
- > npm test

## Build
- > npm run build
